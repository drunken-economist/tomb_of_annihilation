Rae stood in the far hallway of the the shrine of Shagambi. Three clay warriors behind their heavy gates returned his gaze, lifelessly. They had retrieved one of four ceremonial spears after a protracted one-on-one combat. Rae knew he couldn't survive another show-down with one, but suspected that stepping back into the central pit would trigger another portcullis to rise. He called for help from above, and Zoso, Orvex, and Poppinfresh tied a loop to the end of a length of hempen rope and dropped it down in front of the eastern hallway's opening. Rae swung out while the trio pulled him back through the bars criss-crossing the ceiling of the gladiator pit. Up above, they debated how to proceed. They worried that without help, nobody would survive the combat . . . but also that helping the champion would either draw more adversaries or result in something worse. From his vantage point in the western entrance to the pit, Sid was unable to hear the conversation and boldly stepped into the gladiator arena. As expected, the floor shifted under him, and the resulting sound of iron on stone alerted everyone that a portcullis had opened. 

The heavy footprints slapped down the passageway and turned the corner, an identical clay warrior with shield and spear entering the pit. From above, everyone attacked. No sooner had their first attacks landed than two more constructs emerged, confirming their worry that it would draw them all. Sid absorbed the attacks of the three charging fighters and stepped back into the narrow hallway, knowing he could bottleneck the animated warriors. As he left the pit, the floor bounced back into place and the demeanor. One pursued him while the others moved directly the to walls of the pit and climbed out. Zoso shaped himself into a panther, and Poppinfresh cast Misty Step to reach the pit floor and escape the closest threat. 

All three of the constructs immediately descended on him, the third attack knocking him unconscious. Luckily the animated triumvirate did not continue their attacks on the gnome, instead leaving him be as soon as he was no longer a threat. Rae fired down with bow and killed the warrior closest the Poppinfresh, banishing him to a cloud of clay dust and a solid spear clattering to the floor. Sid was able to reach Poppinfresh with a Healing Word, but immediately as he recovered the remaining two warriors made a beeline toward the pit. Orvex and Zoso were able to hammer one of the pair with two critical hits on opportunity attacks, easily dropping the monster into a puff of dust. Unlike the others, though, this one didn't drop his spear. Adamar quickly realized that a clay warrior destroyed outside the pit doesn't drop its spear and instead simply is reconstructed in its cell, so he hopped down to the floor and, with a few strong attacks from his magical yklawa and signature gonad strikes, brought down the fourth just as a new warrior merged. Now able to focus their damage, Orvex and Zoso climbed into the pit and the party soon brought it down. 

They grabbed the three spears from the floor of the gladiatorial arena, placing the simultaneously in the hands of the statues on the first floor. The pedestal on the northern end of the shrine revolved a further three-quarters clockwise and revealed a pair of shelves. The top shelf, as expected, held a small cube with an engraving of Shagambi, the kamadan trickster god. Underneath sat a small glass vial holding several ounces of pink liquid. The
