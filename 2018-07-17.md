Sid stepped out of the pit into the hallway. One warrior followed him, while the others climbed out of the pit via walls. Poppinfresh dropped into pit, all three moved to attack him, dropping him unconscious. One warrior was destroyed outside pit, turning to dust along with its spear. Adamar, Zoso + Orvex, and Rae finish off one each in the pit, collecting four spears. Retrieved puzzle cube and vial of pink liquid. Traveled two miles SE of Omu to rest. Orvex told about Zagmira, his boss and asked to make etching of cubes. Cubes were gone from BoH. Man emerged from jungle to campsite, claimed he was Artus Cimber.

## Summary
Rae stood in the far hallway of the the shrine of Shagambi. Three clay warriors behind their heavy gates returned his gaze, lifelessly. They had retrieved one of four ceremonial spears after a protracted one-on-one combat. Rae knew he couldn't survive another show-down with one, but suspected that stepping back into the central pit would trigger another portcullis to rise. He called for help from above, and Zoso, Orvex, and Poppinfresh tied a loop to the end of a length of hempen rope and dropped it down in front of the eastern hallway's opening. Rae swung out while the trio pulled him back through the bars criss-crossing the ceiling of the gladiator pit. Up above, they debated how to proceed. They worried that without help, nobody would survive the combat . . . but also that helping the champion would either draw more adversaries or result in something worse. From his vantage point in the western entrance to the pit, Sid was unable to hear the conversation and boldly stepped into the gladiator arena. As expected, the floor shifted under him, and the resulting sound of iron on stone alerted everyone that a portcullis had opened. 

The heavy footprints slapped down the passageway and turned the corner, an identical clay warrior with shield and spear entering the pit. From above, everyone attacked. No sooner had their first attacks landed than two more constructs emerged, confirming their worry that it would draw them all. Sid absorbed the attacks of the three charging fighters and stepped back into the narrow hallway, knowing he could bottleneck the animated warriors. As he left the pit, the floor bounced back into place and the demeanor. One pursued him while the others moved directly the to walls of the pit and climbed out. Zoso shaped himself into a panther, and Poppinfresh cast Misty Step to reach the pit floor and escape the closest threat. 

All three of the constructs immediately descended on him, the third attack knocking him unconscious. Luckily the animated triumvirate did not continue their attacks on the gnome, instead leaving him be as soon as he was no longer a threat. Rae fired down with bow and killed the warrior closest the Poppinfresh, banishing him to a cloud of clay dust and a solid spear clattering to the floor. Sid was able to reach Poppinfresh with a Healing Word, but immediately as he recovered the remaining two warriors made a beeline toward the pit. Orvex and Zoso were able to hammer one of the pair with two critical hits on opportunity attacks, easily dropping the monster into a puff of dust. Unlike the others, though, this one didn't drop his spear. Adamar quickly realized that a clay warrior destroyed outside the pit doesn't drop its spear and instead simply is reconstructed in its cell, so he hopped down to the floor and, with a few strong attacks from his magical yklwa and signature gonad strikes, brought down the fourth just as a new warrior merged. Now able to focus their damage, Orvex and Zoso climbed into the pit and the party soon brought it down. 

They grabbed the three spears from the floor of the gladiatorial arena, placing the simultaneously in the hands of the statues on the first floor. The pedestal on the northern end of the shrine revolved a further three-quarters clockwise and revealed a pair of shelves. The top shelf, as expected, held a small cube with an engraving of Shagambi, the kamadan trickster god. Underneath sat a small glass vial holding several ounces of pink liquid. The bottle exuded an aura of powerful restoration, so the party retrieved it along with the cube, tossing both in the Bag of Holding.

Sid slung Poppinfresh's unconscious body over the back of Zoso's panther form and the group quickly exited the Shrine, making a decision to get themselves out of Omu to rest and heal up. They pushed south along the main boulevard of Omu, then west out the grand staircase. Moving quickly through the jungle, they managed to put two miles between themselves and lost city. They set up camp while Poppinfresh regained his bearings, and Orvex requested to make a charcoal rubbing of the cubes to keep a record. When Zoso reached into the Bag of Holding, though, he wasn't able to retrieve the cubes - they had vanished. 

The discouraged and frustrated party sat around the fire and ate their meal, theorizing aloud that perhaps placing the cubes in the extradimensional Bag of Holding had caused them to vanish. As they spoke, a tall, thirty-something human emerged from the edge of the jungle clearing. He held up his hands, showing he was unarmed. The adventurers demanded to know who he was.

"Cimber. Artus Cimber."
