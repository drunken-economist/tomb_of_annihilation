**Zoso's Mezro Background**

>Zoso had hitched a ride aboard a clipper heading south, bound for the Chultan pennisula. The legends of ruined cities there had always fascinated him, and with his latest information, he was sure he'd be able to find something worth his time. He last visit to Waterdeep had proved quite fortuitous - a late night at the Yawning Portal led to an introduction to a young human, Nera, claiming to be from Mezro. Her 16 years seemed a bit too young for the timeline she presented, but every other detail matched with rumors Zoso had collected. She claimed she had grown up in Mezro; its hanging gardens and marbled libraries were her home. The jungles of Chult were never truly safe, but the mages and warriors of the city kept the threats at bay. Seven years ago, though, a new threat emerged. Mezroan hunting parties were ambushed, the survivors telling tales of snake-people. The disappearances soon began to occur within the walls of the city itself. Mezro was longer safe. Nera's father, one of the most powerful mages in Mezro, sent her to Waterdeep to continue her studies. Nera said this had all occurred just under five years prior to their meeting.

>Presently looking out of the ruins, Zoso wondered how a city overrun only five years ago could have been so aggressively reclaimed by nature. He had studied diligently, and would have been willing to bet all his archaeological knowledge on this city ruin being over a century old, perhaps 150 years. Trees had pushed through rocky streets, waterways had overrun gutters and curbs, almost no sign of early lichens remained. The layout of the ruined city certainty matched those of the old maps, and the location was exactly where the young woman calimed it to be . . . but how does a thriving city become a century-old ruin in only half a decade?

>He cautiously ventured into the city, making etchings of the graffiti he saw. They seemed to be of no consequence, claiming "Dragonbait was here" or "Tunnel Snakes rule", but Zoso had long since learned that thorough documentation can be the difference between understanding and mystery. The city was laid out in a huge circle, with two main boulevards quadrisecitng. As he made his way from North to South, the sound of metal boots and armor rung through the air to the west. Zoso ducked into a ruined building to his left, and, seeing ten jaculi inside, spoke calm, magically-imbued words of friendships to the beasts therein.

>A column of four dozen soldiers marched past, carrying banners of the Flaming Fist. Several carried between them large crates, doubtless the spoils of their pillage of the city. Zoso could sense the disgust of the jaculi nest, and didn't even try to stop them from attacking. The jaculi sprung from their hiding places coiled around trees, taking down a third of the Fist soldiers in an instant. The battle-hardened humans, though, weren't willing to flee. They decimated the serpents immediately with a disciplined counter-attack.

>Half a minute later the street was littered with corpses, both snake and human alike. The three surviving serpents, fled into the vines choking the ruined buildings, Zoso close behind after wildshaping. He watched as the Flaming Fist soldiers abandoned their wounded to die, choosing to carry their ill-gotten treasure instead of their fallen comrades.

# Blog
Chatted with Artus Cimber while Rae Kwon fanboyed endlessly. Found out that Cimber is outside of Omu developing a plan to overthrow Ras Nsi as Cimber believes Nsi is responsible for the razing and planeshifting of the entire city of Mezro, where his wife may still be. Discovered that Orvex was continuing to work with the Red Wizards and had been delivering information to them regarding our movements. Orvex also revealed that the shrines remained completed and the puzzle cubes returned to the shrines if they were taken too far from the walls of Omu, the group could go back, but the Red Wizards were also on their way.  Once this information was revealed, Zoso and Rae executed Orvex, much to Cimber's delight. The group worked with Cimber to develop a plan to assist in his plan to overthrow Nsi with the help of a disgruntled high-ranking Yuan-ti wishing to rule herself, but on the way would stop at the Kubazahn Shrine to deal with the Red Wizards. The group easily dispatched the guards hired by the wizards to watch the outside of the shrine with some help from a Poppinfresh illusion and the frog monster. The Red Wizards proved a slightly more difficult challenge, but not by much. Unfortunately the leader was able to dimension door to safety, but a prisoner is leading the group to where they stayed after their earlier battle with the Yaun-ti where Orvex was originally found.

## Summary

The tall, brown-haired man stepped from the underbrush into the campsite. Artus Cimber introduced himself to Poppinfresh, and the pair chatted. Each demanded to know why the other was this deep in the jungles of Chult. As they talked, Poppinfresh woke up Orvex, Zoso and Rae from their slumber, only to immediately regret the decision as the latter was clearly starstruck. While Rae stood mouth agape and Orvex eyed the stranger, Poppinfresh and Zoso explained their dealings with the Death Curse, their investigation of the Soulmonger allegedly feeding the atropal, and their encounter with the shrines.

Artus, cautious of the fanboy but still flattered, explained that he was traveling Chult to seek out Ras Nsi. The serpentine warlord had attacked Mezro during the Spellplague, apparently reducing the city to ruins and destroying all trace of its inhabitants. The legendary adventurer continued, explain that his wife Alisandra had been living in Mezro. Desperate, Artus had spent vast fortunes and nearly a decade to discover that Mezro hadn't been destroyed, but instead had carefully crafted powerful magic to plane-shift away from Ras Nsi's army. He believed that if he brought down Ras Nsi, he could restore Mezro to the Material Plane and reunite with his lost paramore. Zoso listened carefully and, hearing Cimber's tale, offered his own experience in turn. He explained how he had befriended a young woman in Waterdeep who claimed to be from Mezro, how he had traveled to Chult to the city's ruins, how he had found them suspiciously "perfect" . . . Zoso's exploration and skepticism of the Mezroan ruins matched perfectly to Artus's timeline. Cimber explained that over the last few years, he's made contact with Ras Nsi's seditious right-hand, a yuan-ti woman named Fenthaza. 

It was only then that Artus addressed the group's newest member, Orvex. When Artus discovered that the man had served with the Red Wizards, he immediately became quiet and wished the party luck, heading through the camp to leave. As he parted, he warned that he's more than once seen the Red Wizards scry via gold pieces, and he couldn't take the chance. It was clear that the presence of this man worried him, and in fact as Zoso looked at Orvex, the human was shifting his weight foot to foot suspiciously. Zoso stepped to him and grabbed his arm, while Rae and Poppinfresh stopped Artus's exit.

Even as they offered to replace Orvex's gold with their own and bury that of the Red Wizards, Zoso could tell that Orvex was withholding the truth. As Rae rounded on him, Artus tapped the blue-inlaid gold ring on his finger and cast *Suggestion*, commanding the translator to tell everything that would be useful to the party in Omu.

Orvex began to speak. He told the group that while it was true the camp in which they found him was overrun by yuan-ti, he was not simply a translator. Zagmira, the most senior Red Wizard of the Omuan expeditionary force, had hatched a plan to plant Orvex as a spy among the party of adventurers. He continued to admit he had been relaying all their movements and progress to the remainder of the Red Wizards' force. Orvex knew the cubes, if taken more than a mile outside the city, teleported back to their perches. He assumed the wizards and their guard were waiting to collect the cubes from the party's cleared shrines to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods. 

As Orvex completed his admission, Rae and Zoso stepped forward and executed him, an arrow down his throat and sidesword across the chest. Artus Cimber chuckled in approval, a sound that summoned a wide grin from Rae.

The new allies broke down their camp and began to walk toward Omu, knowing that all their fates, at least for now, lie in the lost city. Along the way, they realized that a mutually-beneficial plan was possible. Cimber needed help to ensure Fenthaza's rebellion would succeed in overthrowing Ras Nsi, while the party could use help retrieving at least one of the cubes to prevent the Red Wizards or yuan-ti from obtaining all nine. Having been to the city and adept at navigating the ruins, Zoso would lead Artus to the palace compound and the group would do what they could to help the rebellion, provided along the way they could attempt to recover cubes from the shrines, perhaps hunting down the Red Wizards. Artus seemed almost nostalgic to be working in a group of adventurers again. He dug around his bag, producing a pair of items for the group to use, though he made it clear they were to be promptly returned at the end of their time together. He handed Poppinfresh a *Wand of Wonder*, and Rae a *Ring of Spell Storing*. The pair spent the rest of their hime to Omu attuning to the items.

The entered Omu via the grand staircase and Zoso led them up the main boulevard. He and Rae examined the overgrowth and determined that a group of several humanoids had passed through recently, veering off toward Kubazn's Shrine. They followed the trail, moving slowly and stealthily. Approaching the familiar shrine of the froghemoth, seeing four human guards lazily standing around the murky pool, obviously the Red Wizard's hired muscle. 

Poppinfresh created the illusions of wizard, drawing on his memory of the flayed one they had seen weeks earlier in on the river. The illusion stepped from the undergrowth and called over the guards. When the thugs approached, Poppinfresh caused the illusions to "slip" into the water, reaching out to one of them. The victim fell too, and the forghemoth immediately pounced on his delivered meal. Zoso fired an arrow at the next, taking him down in one shot. Artus cast Bigby's Hand from the ring, summoning a huge icy hand to shove a third into the pool, While Rae unload his bow on the fourth. Hearing the commotion, three more guards emerged from the shrine, flanking two wizards in red robes. Rae charged the newcomers, while Poppinfresh and Zoso ducked behind a close wall for cover, as two more wizards exited the shrine. One of the wizards called out, seeing Rae. Her red robes were trimmed in purple, and while the left side of her body looked young and beautiful, the right side was old and withered. She spoke with the weight of authority, proposing a truce. Behind her, the other Red Wizards held spells, ready to unleash. Rae, eager to impress Cimber, refused the offer, and was immediately hit by three *Fireballs*. As Zoso felled the two remaining, Artus cast a *Wall of Ice* in front of the wizards, and Poppinfresh brought forth an illusory froghemoth to frighten the wizards. The leader *Misty Stepped* out from behind the wall, only to bound by Rae's maledict. Realizing her cause was lost, she cast *Dimension Door* to teleport away. The remaining wizards tried to flee as well, casting *Fly*, but Zoso's arrow trained on one forced him to the ground. Rae bound the other dropping him to ground. 

The summarily executed one, and questioned the other. The scared caster explained that like the party, he had no way of knowing when she had teleported to. He said that the remainder of the Red Wizards' cadre had taken refuge in a cellar under the marketplace, after clearing out some kobolds.
