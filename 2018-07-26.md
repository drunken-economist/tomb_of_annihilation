**Zoso's Mezro Background**

>Zoso had hitched a ride aboard a clipper heading south, bound for the Chultan pennisula. The legends of ruined cities there had always fascinated him, and with his latest information, he was sure he'd be able to find something worth his time. He last visit to Waterdeep had proved quite fortuitous - a late night at the Yawning Portal led to an introduction to a young human, Nera, claiming to be from Mezro. Her 16 years seemed a bit too young for the timeline she presented, but every other detail matched with rumors Zoso had collected. She claimed she had grown up in Mezro; its hanging gardens and marbled libraries were her home. The jungles of Chult were never truly safe, but the mages and warriors of the city kept the threats at bay. Seven years ago, though, a new threat emerged. Mezroan hunting parties were ambushed, the survivors telling tales of snake-people. The disappearances soon began to occur within the walls of the city itself. Mezro was longer safe. Nera's father, one of the most powerful mages in Mezro, sent her to Waterdeep to continue her studies. Nera said this had all occurred just under five years prior to their meeting.

>Presently looking out of the ruins, Zoso wondered how a city overrun only five years ago could have been so aggressively reclaimed by nature. He had studied diligently, and would have been willing to bet all his archaeological knowledge on this city ruin being over a century old, perhaps 150 years. Trees had pushed through rocky streets, waterways had overrun gutters and curbs, almost no sign of early lichens remained. The layout of the ruined city certainty matched those of the old maps, and the location was exactly where the young woman calimed it to be . . . but how does a thriving city become a century-old ruin in only half a decade?

>He cautiously ventured into the city, making etchings of the graffiti he saw. They seemed to be of no consequence, claiming "Dragonbait was here" or "Tunnel Snakes rule", but Zoso had long since learned that thorough documentation can be the difference between understanding and mystery. The city was laid out in a huge circle, with two main boulevards quadrisecitng. As he made his way from North to South, the sound of metal boots and armor rung through the air to the west. Zoso ducked into a ruined building to his left, and, seeing ten jaculi inside, spoke calm, magically-imbued words of friendships to the beasts therein.

>A column of four dozen soldiers marched past, carrying banners of the Flaming Fist. Several carried between them large crates, doubtless the spoils of their pillage of the city. Zoso could sense the disgust of the jaculi nest, and didn't even try to stop them from attacking. The jaculi sprung from their hiding places coiled around trees, taking down a third of the Fist soldiers in an instant. The battle-hardened humans, though, weren't willing to flee. They decimated the serpents immediately with a disciplined counter-attack.

>Half a minute later the street was littered with corpses, both snake and human alike. The three surviving serpents, fled into the vines choking the ruined buildings, Zoso close behind after wildshaping. He watched as the Flaming Fist soldiers abandoned their wounded to die, choosing to carry their ill-gotten treasure instead of their fallen comrades.
