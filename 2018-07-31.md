The party had defeated the Red Wizard platoon and taken a prisoner, Behmam. Zoso saw that the cube was still inside the shrine so hopped beam to beam to retrieve it, but fell on the way back. Zoso made a burrow to rest. Sid drifted off, woke up with a hag in his face, interrogating him. Artus sugeested the hags may have created a clone of Sid to track the party. They questioned Behmam, who suggested an alliance with the Red Wizards, since they had similar goals. The group headed toward the palace to infiltrate, crossing a fallen tree across the river. Bag of Nails attacked, Behmam turned himself invisble. The tabaxi surrendered and offered to feed them. Gave Rae poison. Met with contact of Fenthaza, polymorphed into yuan-ti (Rae and Amdamar posed as prisoners). Entered the temple, met with Fenthaza, who assigned works for them under the cover of slaves.

## Summary

The party had felled the Red Wizards' hired muscle and killed two of the mages (imprisoning a third), although Zagmira had escaped via a Dimension Door. While the others rounded up the prisoner, Zoso looked inside the shrine of Kubazan. A small stone sube sat on the pedestal at the far end of the rectangular pit. Although he had previously retrieved the cube with a _Jump_, the human wanted to preserve his spellcasting abilities for potential hurdles later in the day. He eyed up the wooden beams sticking out of the wall and deftly made his way around the perimeter of the pit, hopping beam to beam with ease. When he reached the other side, he retrieved the cube engraved with Kubazan the Froghemoth, replacing it with a bag of 25 silver pieces, the shrine's inscription ("Kubazan urges us to tread without fear and to give back as much as we take") echoing through his head. With the cube in hand, he continued clockwise, hopping toward the first beam. Unfortunately, the wet stone underneath offered little purchase, and Zoso slipped, falling thrity feet to the spikes below. He took a moment to breathe and squeezed his way between the sharpened sticks back to the entrance, where he cimbed back up and out of the pit. 

Back in the sunlight, the group walked just southeast of teh shrine, and Zoso cast _Borrrow Trick_, creating a magical underground borrow for the Lost Boys, accompanied by Artus and Behmam, to rest for an hour. The group entering, and Artus placed himself between the prisoner and the door. As they began to question the wizard, an exhausted Sid slouched in the corner, drifiting off to sleep.

While he slept, the group questioned their prisoner. The young wizard was scared for his life, but pointed out that he had surrendered voluntarily and had caused the party no harm at all - in fact it was *they* who had attacked the Red Wizards without provocation. He explained that his group was in Omu for the same reason as the party - to find the source of and stop the death curse - and suggested perhaps the two groups could work together. He offered to show the group to the Red Wizard's camp in the kobold cellars, and would even vouch for the party's integrity if they treated him with respect. The Lost Boys, though, instead openly discussed executing the helpless man, only allowing him to live after he begged for his life and they thought there may still be use for him before they kill him.

Sid awoke on a cold, dank stone floor. He didn't feel the weight of his armor on his body; he was dressed in filthy rags. His eyes adjusted to the light and he saw a heavy iron cage in front of his face. From the other side, a familiar sight came into focus. Peering through the gaps in the bars was the sickening face of a night hag, the very same that they had encoutered days earlier in the Aldani Basin. The hag reached a knotted finger through the cage, resting it on his cheek. Sid tried to grab her arm, but found his muslces too weak to move his limbs beyond a twitch. The hag began to interrogate him, adding a Suggestion to her wicked voice. She asked Sid who he was traveling with, what the group knew, and what their plans were. She seemed particularly interested in what they knew about the source of the death curse, and smiled a toothy grin when Sid said they dind't know much except that it was behind the do in the north of Omu. 

Sid snapped back to conscienceness on the floor of the burrow, concerned friends around him. He told what he had experienced, and Artus suggested that it may not have been a dream. He told them that hags were known to collect hair or blood to create psuedoclones of victims. These clones are telepathically linked to the original, and have all the knowledge and memories of the host. Torturing and questioning these clones, the hags are able to keep tabs on the victim and their traveling companions. 

Despite the restless nap, the group had recovered enough that they felt comfortable contuining onward, heading northeast to meet with Fenthaza's contact and inflitrate the palace of the Yuan-ti. They began westward, soon finding themselves at the banks of the flooded river, rushing past them north to south, before tumbling over a waterfall 200 feet later. A huge tree had fallen across the river, forming a bridge as wide as a man is tall. The party grabbed rope and began tying themselves off in pairs: Adamar and Rae, Sid and Zoso, Artus and Behmam. In that order, they began to cross the natural bridge. Adamar and Rae reached the halfway point, as Sid and Zoso prepared to step on the trunk. From the distance, an arrow flew toward them, striking Rae. A second fell short, impacting the tree under Adamar's feet. Over 150 feet away, the shape of a tabaxi, feathered headress atop his head, ducked behind foliage again. Zoso spotted the feline hunter and unleashed a volley of his own, striking the cat in the neck from hundreds of feet away. Behmam cut the rope tying him to Artus while Adamar and Rae rushed across, eager to get out of the river's footprint. The captured wizard glanced around and whispered a spell, turning invisible and leaving Sid grasping for air in an attempt to catch him. On the other side of the river, the injured tabaxi dropped his bow, surrendering to the charging blood hunter and monk. As the Lost Boys reconvened on the far side of the river, the tabaxi offered them a meal as a show of respect. Perhaps thinking the elder hunter could share some wisdom of the city, they accepted and followed him into his burrow.

The cat introduced himself as Bag of Nails, explaining that he had come to Omu after Jessamine had put a sanction on him. He knew his time was limited, and intended to seek glory in the hunt for the King of Feathers. Bag of Nails continued to explain, as he poured several bowls of stew, that he had encountered the magical dinosaur thrice, each time closer to killing it. The beast wasn't an easy hunt, as it had the ability to teleport and was more resiliant than any dinosaur he had encountered yet. As they enjoyed the meal, they told Bag of Nails that he was in fact on their sanction list, but had no intention of killing the tabaxi for his transgression of refusing Jessamine's orders. Besides, Adamar pointed out, collecting on the bounty would require months of travel anyway. The grateful hunter offered them a small bottle to help on their way, a dose of Midnight Tears. While they finished the meal, Zoso spent several minutes rolling his druidic glyphs in his hands, calling up on the higher forces to guide him. He asked about their next course of action, suggesting they meet Fenthaza's contact and help Artus bring down Ras Nsi. He tossed the inscribed wooden pieces, and studied them, determining that they resulting in "weal", indicating a positive outcome. With that, they departed.

They continued across the city, ignoring the ruined buildings along the way, until they reached the ancient palace. Nearby, they waited at the designated spot for Fenthaza's contact. Soon after their arrival, a yuan-ti pureblood approach their stakeout point. He recognized Artus, but refused to give his own name. He was under strict instructions, he said, to polymorph those who wished into yuan-ti, and direct them through the main entrance of the yuan-ti stronghold to Fenthaza's chambers. Cimber, Zoso, and Sid allowed themselves to be changed into yuan-ti, while Adamar and Rae acted as prisoners. The yuan-ti gave them their instructions, warned that the polymorph would only last an hour, and quickly made his exit. 

The group followed his direction to the north side of the palace, down a sloping ramp into the catacombs below. The hallway terminated as a pair of enormous sliding doors, with small, square openings carved along the base, allowing the passage of snakes. Sid approached the door, pounding a large fist against it. A hidden peeophole slid open, and a pair of snake-like eyes darted back and forth behind it. In abyssal, Sid explained that while they could obviously transform into snakes and use the cutouts, the prisoners wouldn't be able to. The exasperated yuan-ti guard shut the peephole and slid the door open, revealing the hallway within. Confidently following the directions of Cimber's contact, they strode through and turned left down an offshooting, narrower hallway, and stopped at a hammered brass doorway on the left. They knocked. Two hulking guards emerged from within, standing aside at a hushed order from within.

A haze of incense lingered inside the chamber. Faded murals decorated the walls, and throw rugs and cushions were scattered on the floor. An engraved chest rested in one corner next to a stone urn covered with snake carvings. A creature with the head and upper body of a dark-skinned woman and the lower body of a serpent coiled in the middle of the room. She rose, greeting them and dispelling the polymorph. She introduced herself as Fenthaza, and thanked Artus for agreeing to help. She explained that she wanted to overthrow Ras Nsi, knowing that he could never truly serve Dendar the Night Serpent while he clung to the shreds of his human form. She knew that if Ras Nsi were killed, she would be able to seize the reigns of power and could bring about Dendar's return. Her plan, as she explained, was to have Artus and the party join the slaves, sowing discontent and bringing about an uprising. It was vital to her that no yuan-ti loyal to her were involved in the plan until it was sure that the revolution would succeed. She assigned each them a work detail, offering to store their weapons and armor safely in the armory and giving the passphrase for when the time was right. She explained that they should keep their heads down and proceed quickly and quietly to their assignments; the yuan-ti wouldn't pay attention to "lesser beings" unless they drew attention to themselves.
