The party had defeated the Red Wizard platoon and taken a prisoner, Behmam. Zoso saw that the cube was still inside the shrine so hopped beam to beam to retrieve it, but fell on the way back. Zoso made a burrow to rest. Sid drifted off, woke up with a hag in his face, interrogating him. Artus sugeested the hags may have created a clone of Sid to track the party. They questioned Behmam, who suggested an alliance with the Red Wizards, since they had similar goals. The group headed toward the palace to infiltrate, crossing a fallen tree across the river. Bag of Nails attacked, Behmam turned himself invisble. The tabaxi surrendered and offered to feed them. Gave Rae poison. Met with contact of Fenthaza, polymorphed into yuan-ti (Rae and Amdamar posed as prisoners). Entered the temple, met with Fenthaza, who assigned works for them under the cover of slaves.

## Summary

The party had felled the Red Wizards' hired muscle and killed two of the mages (imprisoning a third), although Zagmira had escaped via a Dimension Door. While the others rounded up the prisoner, Zoso looked inside the shrine of Kubazan. A small stone sube sat on the pedestal at the far end of the rectangular pit
